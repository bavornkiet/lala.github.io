            <p>Hallooo I don't know whether you can remember or not, but I think I used to tell you that I really wanted
                to create a website for someone I care about deeply, someoone who means the world to me. At first, I
                imagined it will be used as a surprise for a
                special occasionâ€”maybe our anniversary or your birthday, or simply to show you how much you mean to me.
                I never expected to be making it for you in difficult times like this for both of us hahahah. But
                whatever I really just want to make this for you
                (Caution<i id="ss" class="fas fa-exclamation"></i><i id="ss" class="fas fa-exclamation"></i><i id="ss"
                    class="fas fa-exclamation"></i>
                It might not be the prettiest website, but it's sure filled with
                so much
                love from your dumbo.) I hope you enjoy gliding through our space-time memories. <i style="color: pink;"
