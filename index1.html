                <small>11 March 2023</small>
                <p>
                    "yoo hbd lala mks makk2 naa" i sent a hbd message to you and you replied "thank uu naa billll
                    (heart)(heart)(smile)(smile)" and then we started talking so much in text then a few days later we
                    started to phone call each other, I was really nervous the first time I talked to you. You were sso
                    talkative the first day we call, w're not close in anglo but somehow we manage to talk so much that
                    day</p>

                <h2>The Long Distance Relationship</h2>
                <small>March - April</small>
                <p>Although, this phase was only roughly 1 and a half month, it was so significant for my feeling
                    towards you.
                    You would always sleep around 5am, everytime we call each other, it was so fun talking to you. I
                    will always be begging you to stay 5 minutes more
                    which always turn out to be like an hr more hahahah.
                    I actually do like long-distance quite a lot too, it makes me realize how important you are to me.

                <small>8 June 2023</small>
                <p>Not Gonna Lie, mig is actually our love angel. If it weren't because of him that day we wouldn't be
                    able to gub mar kui gun.
                    I remember that day we went to buy channel perfume for your tata and then JR gotta go on a date with
                    nammy so you me and mig gotta hang out
                    together. NGL I still miss that arharn esan beside your condo, mai ruu ja dai gin eek pao. After Mig
                    left, we pai sue that big duck hai Porsche,
                    i still remember that moment, it just feels like there's only 2 of us in this world, you were the
                    only thing in my brain i bab luem the rest of the world
                    pai leoy you actually became "My World" tornnun. I was so into you after that day which is why I
                    called you at like
                    3am after night out w the boys. My head hurt like hell when i was taking to you, but somehow it also
                    feels quite relieving. I was so happy that
                    night that I ended up talking to new until sunrise instead of going to bed to cure my headache.

                    that tuktuk, i still remember it's like 300 baht
                    for like 5km, but nvm it was nice seeing bangkok at night w u on tuktuk (i mean i did not pay for it
                    too). We went to eat so many things and pretended to be kon from like
                    10 countries mung, i still remeber that we talk to the maekar in chinese and she gave us sth and til
                    this day i still dk what that meat is hahahha, we also went to eat some kaijeow too
                    and we pretend to be fish and chips land peep, although our accent was reallllllyyy offffff. OOOHH
